### PROJECT NAME: 
Practical Machine Learning - PREDICT 422 - Final Course Assignment


### DESCRIPTION: 
- Developed classification and regression models for predicting likely donors and their donation amounts for a ficticious charitable organization  <br /> 
- Built 10 classification models and 9 regression models and evaluated them using the holdout method  <br /> 
- Selected Generalized Boosted Models (GBM) for both problems.  For classification, GBM had the highest expected profit and for regression, it had the lowest mean squared error (1.55)


### SOFTWARE: 
Jupyter Notebook, R
